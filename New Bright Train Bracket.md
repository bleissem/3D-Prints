New Bright Train Valve Gear
===========================

The piece that connects the piston rod to the valve chest near the front of a 1986 New Bright toy train.  The original piece was black with white stripes.

The model fits the left side of the train; it could be mirrored to fit the right. It should fit into place, but it will need to be glued on the end that connects to the train body.
