Coach-Sunglass-Accent
==============================

3D model of an accent from the earpiece for a pair of Coach sunglasses. I don't know the specific model or type of the glasses.

Printing
========

The object needs no supports and should be printed with 100% infill.

Installation
============

Glue it into place in the sunglasses. You may have to expand the holes for the pegs to 2mm with a drill; the original factory holes are closer to 1.5mm.
