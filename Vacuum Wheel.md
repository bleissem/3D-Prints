Kenmore Whispertone Vacuum Wheel
================================
Replacement wheel for a Kenmore Whispertone 12.0 Vacuum.

I wasn't able to print a replacement that could withstand the stress of being clipped onto the vacuum. You might be more successful with different slicing settings or printing with something other than ABS, like a more solid rubbery plastic.
